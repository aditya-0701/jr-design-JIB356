# Instructions for Devs

This is the demo app that we are building for our final presentation during the Fall 2020 semester. This app will only have the functionality to create and log in to your student or alumni profile. It is being built using React Native with a Firebase DB.

## Getting Started

- Clone the entire github repository to your local machine and create a new branch for yourself. Do NOT commit directly to the master branch. 
- After cloning the repository, navigate to this folder in your shell (CMD, gitbash, terminal etc.) and run `npm install`. 
  - If you do not have have node and npm installed, google how to install Node.js and install it. We are currently using Node 15.0.1 for this project. 
- After running `npm install`, run `expo start` to check whether your steps were successful. If they were succesful, the app will start up and a QR code will be displayed that you can use to run the app on your phone.

## Editing the App 

- To edit the app, navigate to the src folder and edit the corresponding file where you want to make changes. 
- We will be following a similar folder structure to this https://cheesecakelabs.com/blog/efficient-way-structure-react-native-projects/
